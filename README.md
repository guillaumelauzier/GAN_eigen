# GAN_eigen

Here is an example of a generative adversarial network (GAN) implemented in C++ for generating AI art.

After the code that has been provided, the next steps would be to update the generator and discriminator networks using the computed loss and gradients. This would typically involve using an optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent, to update the network weights and biases in order to minimize the loss. After updating the networks, the process of generating and evaluating art would be repeated for a number of iterations in order to train the GAN and improve the quality of the generated art. Additionally, the generated art may be displayed or saved to a file for further analysis.
